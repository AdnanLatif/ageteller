This code takes input of age and weight and check that if age and weight is average according
to World Health Stats.

Also snake_case if used in first query and camelCase is used in second query. I suggest to use camelCase.

Put break after isAv = true so loop will not run again and again.
Also put break in outer loop. Inner break will only stop execution of inner loop.
We can also place all conditions in one if statement.
No need to check if (ag <= 12 && ag >= 6) Just we can check one if (ag >= 6).
Put exceptionMessage in variable because message is same so we can change it at one place.
